# Concepts

## Dependencies

Dependencies are one of prepack core concepts. A dependency is another package that your package needs in order to work. Dependencies are specified in your package spec.

You only list immediate dependenciesâ€”the software that your package uses directly. Prepack handles transitive dependencies for you.
